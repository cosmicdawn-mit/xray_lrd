This is based on the dataset included in the AEGIS-XD project (Nandra et al. 2015, ApJS 220, 10). 
The OBSIDs in their Tables 1 and 2 are included. The OBSIDs are divided into seven groups. 
The OBSIDs in the same group have almost the same optical axis (within 1 arcmin) and merged 
for the stacking analysis. Group OBSIDs are--

Normalizations of the exposure maps

The exposure maps *.texp show the effective exposures in seconds, rather than the Chandra standard 
convention of [s cm^2]. Detector sensitivity changes over time, thus the effective exposure maps 
are calculated for the response matrix at the time of a reference observation. The reference observation 
for this dataset is a combination of OBSIDs 9720 and 9723 (observed on 2008-06-17 and 008-06-18 
respectively), which have almost identical optical axes and roll angles. 

If you want to use PIMMS for approximate countrate to flux conversion, use ACIS-I for Chandra Cycle 9. 

Many thanks to Antonis Georgakakis for providing us with reprocessed data.
