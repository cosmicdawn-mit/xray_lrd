! Notes from Dataset (if any):
! 
! 
! This is based on the CDFS data over 3.8 Msec. (ADS/ Sa.CXO#Contrib/ChandraDeepFieldS)
! 
! *** Normalization of the exposure map ***
! 
! The exposure map *.texp is the effective exposure in seconds, rather than 
! the Chandra standard convention of [s cm^2]. Since detector sensitivity change 
! over time, the effective exposure map is calculated for the response matrix at 
! the time of a reference observation. The reference observation for this dataset 
! is OBSID=12049 (observed at '2010-05-28T18:58:11'). 
! 
! If you want to use PIMMS for countrate to flux conversion, use ACIS-I for 
! Chandra Cycle 10.
