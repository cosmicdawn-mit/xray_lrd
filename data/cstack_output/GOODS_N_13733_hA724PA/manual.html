<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">1. Introduction</H2>

The cstack web-site is designed to perform a stacking analysis of
the images from deep/wide survey data. This project started as a
C-COSMOS consortium effort to prvide a tool for COSMOS members who 
have catalogs of objects to obtain stacked X-ray fluxes of these 
objects.  In addition to C-COSMOS and Chandra COSMOS Legacy, we include 
a number of other extragalactic survey fields observed by Chandra. See the
"Dataset" pulldown menu of the entry form. The manual 
<a href="./exclusion.html">supplement</a> shows the source
of the data stored in this site.

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">2. Input Fields</H2>
The input field of the form is self-explanatory (I hope) and the fields 
that require numerical inputs are given reasonable defaults. If any of the 
inputs has an invalid value, the form page will be re-loaded with most 
valid inputs intact. Here are the detailed explanations of each field.
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><b>Root name of this job:</b> A name should be given to the job. The 
  users should give a name consisting of only alphanumerics. A 
  string consisting of an underscore followed by 7 random characters 
  will be attached to give a unique name to your job and to protect 
  your data.  
<LI><b>Energy Bands</b> <i>bands</i>: 
  The tool has three options on the selection of energy bands, as indicated
  on the form. Since stacking is done on each band independently, the 6-band
  option takes approximately 3 times longer than the 2-band option. The rest frame
  option takes still longer.
<LI><b>Maximum off-axis angle</b> <i>maxoff</i> (arcminutes): 
  The stacking will be made over multiple observations. Only the data within 
  this off-axis angle (at the position of the input object) of this value 
  for each observation will be used.   
<LI><b>Size of the stacked image</b> <i>img_size</i> (arcseconds): 
 The size of a side of the square field around each object, in which 
 a stamped image and an exposure map are created. 
<LI><b>Source region radius</b> <i>rad_src</i> (arcseconds): The size 
  of the circular region around these position where the image counts are 
  extracted. If the number is followed by an "R", the  ECF is calculated
  by the Ciao (4.16) task 'src_psffrac' directly. Otherwise, it uses values
  extracted from Chandra::Tools::ECF (already obsolete) with interpolations.  
  If this field is -9 (-5), the source region radius varies with the 
  off axis angle corresponding to 90 (50)% ECF (encircled energy fraction from the
  Proposer's Observatory Guide), with a minimum and maximum radii of 1.0 asec and  
  <i>rad_bkg</i> (see below) respectively. In V4.5, a new option is added.
  If this field is 'nC', where n is a real number between 0 and 0.99 (e.g. '0.9C'),
  the ECF_fraction=n radius is calculated directly by the Ciao (4.16) task
  'psfsize_srcs'.
<LI><b>Inner radius for background</b> <i>rad_bkg</i> 
  (arcseconds): Background counts are accumulated from the region of 
   the stamped image that lies outside of the circular region of this 
  radius.   
<LI><b>Source Exclusion -</b> Objects affected by resolved sources (either
  the object itself is a resolved X-ray source or the source count is heavily
  affected by the X-ray source) should be excluded for obtaining better sensitivity
  in the stacking analysis. The sources used for the exclusion
  can be controlled by three parameters. Source that meet all the three
  criteria are used for the exclusion. See the explanation on source exclusion 
  in the manual <a href="./exclusion.html">supplement</a>
  for details. The source list is internal to the system.
<UL COMPACT TYPE=CIRCLE>
  <LI><b> Min CR:</b> Source count rate, above which the source is excluded. 
  <LI><b> Min Cts:</b> Net source count, above which the source is excluded.
  <LI><b> Max sig/Min ML:</b> (<1) The source significance 
         (in false probability P, as 
         many Chandra source detection software gives), below which the 
         source is excluded. (>1) Source ML = -ln P, like XMM-SAS
         source detection gives. 
</UL>  
 These thresholds can be set independently for the source region and 
 background region.
<LI><b>Input file containing stacking positions:</b> The file can either be
   a FITS file or an ASCII file and the program automatically checks 
   which format. A reasonable maximum number of objects is about 10000.  
   The ASCII file must conform
   to the following standard: 1) Rows starting with an exclamation (!) 
   are for comments and are ignored by the program. 2) The first four 
   columns of each non-comment row must be <b> Src_name RA DEC [Weight [z]]</b>, 
   separated by space characters. If the weight is omitted, the default value
   of 1.0 is used. For the rest-frame stacking option, the fourth and fifth columns 
  (Weight and z) are mandatory.
   3) Additional columns will be ignored. 4) Source names may have no more 
   than 13 characters and may contain only alphanumerics and underscores.
   5) RA and DEC may be in decimal degrees or in the sexagesimal format 
   (HH:MM:SS.SS DD:MM:SS.SS) for ASCII only.  
<LI><b>Entries for FITS input files ---</b>
<UL COMPACT TYPE=CIRCLE>
  <LI><b> Extension nr.:</b> FITS Table Extension (count as primary array=0), 
      which must contain the following columns.
  <LI><b> Column names:</b> FITS Table column names for the Source name, RA,
    DEC, and Weight. Source name must follow the same rule as the ASCII case.
    RA and DEC must be decimal degrees (unlike the ASCII case). 
    Weight=1 means that the weight=1 for all objects.
</UL>  
<b> Note:</b> If the input file is an ASCII file, it is safer to keep 
 FITS input fields to given defaults, because the input fields for the 
 FITS file are still subject to form input format checks.
<LI><b>E-mail address:</b> An e-mail message will be sent after
 the submitted analysis has been made. The message points to the 
 web page that point to the appropriate output products. 
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">3. Analysis Details</H2>

Details of the data and analysis procedures are explained. See above 
input field explanations for variable names, which are displayed in 
<i>italics</i>).
<OL>
<LI> <b>Stored data:</b> A full resolution ASCIS I0-I3 image 
 (0.492x0.492 asec<sup>2</sup> pixels) for each of the 0.5-2 
  and 2-8 keV band for each observation and a corresponding exposure map, 
  generated assuming a monochromatic 1 or 4 keV incident photons.
  Additionally images in the narrower bands (0.5-0.75,0.75-1.25,1.25-2,2-3,3-5 & 5-8 keV) as well 
  as an event list (for the rest-frame stack) are also stored.
<LI> <b>Data extraction:</b> For each position from the input 
   file, for each observation, the program checks if this position is 
   within the <i>offax</i> from the optical axis and if it is  
   unaffected by resolved sources. In this case, for each 
   band, a <i>img_size</i> x <i>img_size</i> square post-stamp
   image centered at the input position and an exposure map covering 
   the same area are extracted from the database.
<LI> <b>Image counts:</b> For each band, the followings are made:
  <UL>
   <LI> For each object, fields (i.e. Chandra observation),
      the pointing centers (optical axes) of which are within 
      <i>maxoff</i> of the object, are selected.
   <LI> For each selected field, check if the source extraction 
      region is contaminated by the X-ray sources (see the
      explanation for the <b>Source exclusion</b> above). If 
      the sexcluding radius (See <a href="./exclusion.html">supplement</a>) 
      of the sources meeting the given criteria overlap with the source extraction 
      circle, this will be flagged as "X-src".
   <LI> Count the event in the source extraction circle
      <i>rad_src</i> (see above for varying source extraction scheme).
       Also ectract the mean exposure of this field.
   <LI> Define the background region as the entire post-stamp image
      excluding 1) the circle centered at the source and the radius 
      <i>rad_bkg</i>, and 2) the source excluding region (See <a href="./exclusion.html">supplement</a>)  
      around the resolved X-ray sources meeting the exclusion from background criteria.
      If sufficient background area has not remained after these
      exclsions (>50% of the source area), it is flagged as "bad_bkg".
      Get event counts and mean exposure in the background region.
   <LI> The count rate of the source for this field is: <br>
     <i>src_rate = (cts_src/exp_src-cts_bkg/exp_bkg/px_bkg*px_src)/ecf</i><br>
   <LI> The statistics are recorded in each row of <b>stat_cts_[band].out</b>.
     The statistics on each field is designated by lbl=n, where n=1,2,3...
     If the neither source/background is contaminated by the X-ray sources,
     it is flagged as "OK". 
 </UL>         
<LI> <b>Stacking for one object:</b> For each object, calculate 
   exposure*weight - weighted
   (and normalized) mean of the rates for the "OK" fields. The statistics 
   on each object is also added to <b>stat_cts_[band].out</b>, designated 
   as lbl="sum". The Field/Comm column shows the number of the "OK" fields,
   or "Obj_rejected" flag if no "OK" field exist.    
<LI> <b>Stacking for all objects:</b> Similarly, calculate 
   exposure*weight - weighted (and normalized) mean of the rates for the 
   accepted objects. The final stacked statistics are also added to 
   <b>stat_cts_[band].out</b>, designated as lbl="All".   
<LI> <b>Bootstrapping:</b> A simple photon-counting statistics is not
   a good way of determining the significance of the stacking,
   especially in case a small fraction of the objects dominate the 
   signal. As one of the good measures, we provide the results 
   of a bootstrap re-sampling analysis. Suppose there are <i>N</i>
   objects accepted for our stacking. Out of these, <i>N</i> objects are 
   selected at random, allowing duplications and the net count rate for these 
   are averaged as the (exposure*weight)-weighted mean value.
   This defines a re-sampled stacked count rate. The program provides 
   the distribution of 500 such re-sampled stacked count rates, a 
   sorted list of these, and a histogram (for each band).

</UL>

<H2 ID="conversion" ALIGN="LEFT">6. Count rate to flux conversion</H2>

We do not provide the count rate to flux conversion. Users
can refer to the original papers of each dataset or can
use (recommended) the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/pimms.jsp">
PIMMS </a> utility at the Chandra X-ray Center to utilize the latest
calibration at the time of the previous proposal cycle. For many dataset,
a brief explanation on the dataset is shown in the results.html page. 

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">7. How long does it take ?</H2>

 Time to complete the job varies from situation to situation and sometimes take very long
if you want to stack thousands of galaxies.  Using Ciao internally, the system has to access
data from a hard disk for each object/each Chandra ObsId/each operation. Since each Chandra 
ObsId. is accessed separately, it takes still more with data with heavily overlapping Chandra 
field configurations like C-COSMOS. <br>

 As a guideline, for approximately stacking about 200 objects on C-COSMOS over two bands, it takes
about 20 minutes on lambic.astrosen.unam.mx. The execution speed on  cstack.ucsd.edu is similar.  

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">8. Caveats, Future Developments?</H2>
<UL>
<LI> If the number of stacked objects is more than several thousands, 
  a Ciao task crashes and the stacked image is not created. Still it gives proper numbers in the 
  stacking analysis results. Sometimes shuffling the order of the input list solves the problem.
  If this happens, consider dividing your input sample such that there are less than about 5000 objects
  in each cstack run. The cause of this problem is still unknown. 
</UL>

I will add whenever I think of anything. If you have suggestions, please 
let me know.
