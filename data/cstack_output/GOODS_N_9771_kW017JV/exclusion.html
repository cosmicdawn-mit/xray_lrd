<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">1. Source Exclusion Details</H2>

 It is essential for the stacking analysis to exclude the parts of 
the data affected by resolved sources. 
 
 From V3.1, the source exclusion scheme has been changed. For each source position in the input 
list, the program looks for the nearest resolved source that meets the selection criteria.
For each of the overlapped observations (fields) that have exposure at that position, it calculates the 
exclusion radius <i>r</i><sub>exc</sub>. For a given source position, each field has a different off-axis 
angle, and therefore a different point spread function. CSTACK version V3.0 (and before)
used the 90% ECF, <i>r</i><sub>90</sub> for <i>r</i><sub>exc</sub>. 
  
From V3.1, we also use the total photon count of the contaminating source in computing 
<i>r</i><sub>exc</sub> as:<br>
<center> 
<i>r</i><sub>exc</sub>=min(max(<i>r</i><sub>90</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>90</sub> sqrt(<i>c</i>/<i>c</i>
<sub>0</sub>)),<i>r</i><sub>max</sub>),
</center>

where <i>c</i> is the total photon count in the resolved source, and we set <i>c</i><sub>0</sub>=50, and 
<i>r</i><sub>max</sub>=25 arcsec. <br>
 
If the distance to the nearest resolved source is smaller than (<i>r</i><sub>exc</sub>+<b>src_rad</b>), 
the source/field is not included in the stacking analysis and
the source/field is flagged as "X-src" in the file "stat_cts_XXXX_XXXX.dat". 
Also the <i>r</i><sub>exc</sub>-radius regions around the resolved sources that meet the 
background criteria are excluded from the calculation of the background level 
in the stacking procedure. <br>

There are three options in resolved source selection: the option "Any" takes the union of 
full, soft, and hard sources and "Full band sources for all" takes the 
sources detected in the full band (0.5-8 keV) for the exclusions for the stacking analysis 
in any energy band. These options are to assure that the same sources are 
excluded in all-bands and to investigate the hardness of the 
stacked sources. The other option "Soft and hard sources separately"
excludes soft (0.5-2keV) and hard (2-8keV) band detected sources
respectively for the stacks in the soft and hard bands respectively.
For the 6-band stack option, 0.5-2 keV band detected sources 
are used for the 0.5-0.75,0.75-1.25  & 1.25-2 keV bands and 2-8 keV
detected sources are used in the  2-3,3-5 & 5-8 keV bands respectively.

 You see how much region is excluded in each source/field in 
"stat_cts_XXXX_XXXX.dat" by looking at the column "px_bkg". If the background 
area has been reduced to less than 50% of the source area in a source/field, it 
is flagged as "bad_bkg" and excluded from the analysis.   
 

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">2. Data Source (images and catalogs)</H2>

All data included in CSTACK are
taken with ACIS-I. CSTACK gives the results in counts per second in the corresponding band. 
The count rate to flux conversions depends on the source spectrum and the obsid 
of the observation, since detector sensitivity changes over 
time. The effective exposure maps are calculated for the response matrix at the time of a 
reference observation for each dataset.  Use the 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/pimms.jsp"> PIMMS utility </a>
for approximate conversions. For the conversion factor with the best calibration, 
use an on-axis ACIS-I respose matrix generated using the latest <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/"> Ciao </a> 
packge on the reference observation of the corresponding dataset (or the corresponding cycle, if the reference
OBSID is not given).
