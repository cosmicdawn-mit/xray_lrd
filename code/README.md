This folder contains the code used for Yue et al. 2024.

convfactor.py: compute the factor between fluxes and luminosities given the column density and the redshift of an AGN.
nh_selenium.py: Use Selenium to grab the Milky Way column density for each source.
pimms_selenium.py: Use Selenium to grab the conversion factor from count rates to physical fluxes from PIMMS.
read_cstack_output.py: Read the output file of CSTACK and compute the probability distribution of photon count rates.
generate_latex_table_code.py: generate latex table code for the Tables in the paper.
makeplots.py: Make the plots (Figure 1 and 2) in the paper.

More details coming.
